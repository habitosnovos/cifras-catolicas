All You’ve given us out of love will ever be

Father, in Your embrace our lives are renewed

That is where the sinner finds Peace
 <b>E</b>             <b>F#m7</b>          <b>E/G#</b>         <b>A</b>
Freely we’ve received what we now want to give

On the altar with the Bread and Wine

You magnify our nothingness!
