My day has gone, the night is bringing
               <b>Eb</b>               <b>Bb9</b>
memories of past, memories of you
       <b>Gm</b>                 <b>C</b>

<b>F</b>             <b>C9/E</b>         <b>Eb</b>
Sleeples and cold, it's four ten,
          <b>Bb9</b>                  <b>F</b>
only four ten at dawn, it's alright,
                <b>C9/E</b>        <b>Eb</b>            <b>Bb9</b>
I'm drinking a coffee, I get up, open the window
        <b>Gm</b>               <b>C</b>
and I scream out loud, loudly

        <b>F</b>             <b>C9/E</b>
Wherever you are, I will be
                 <b>Dm</b>                 <b>Am7</b>
Hoping that you will, be waiting for me
                 <b>Bb9</b>                     <b>F/A</b>
And you must be sure, I'm really your friend

It's only mid-day, of rainy weekend
          <b>Bb9</b>            <b>F</b>
I was in bed, but I woke up
              <b>C9/E</b>            <b>Eb</b>
I put on some pants, I pack my bags
              <b>Bb9</b>         <b>Gm</b>               <b>C</b>
grab my old guitar, Look, I'm right behind you

         <b>F</b>          <b>C9/E</b>
Where you are, I will be

Hoping that you will, be waiting for me
              <b>Bb9</b>                        <b>F/A</b>

<b>F</b>          <b>Eb</b>                            <b>Bb9</b>
Then I realized, that the peace I didn't have
             <b>Eb</b>            <b>C9</b>                       <b>F</b>
Was here inside and I was lost in a castle of illusion
                    <b>Eb</b>                    <b>Bb9</b>
And with my mind clear, I'm coming back home
             <b>Eb</b>
because today I live,

                 <b>F</b>           <b>C9/E</b>
'cause where you are, I will be
               <b>Dm</b>                  <b>Am7</b>
Hoping that too wil, be waiting for me
                  <b>Bb9</b>                   <b>F/A</b>
And you must be sure, I'm really you friend
