<pre style="overflow:hidden"><div class="undefined _2Y--k">
<b>A#m</b>
Lonely
<b>F#</b>
Trying to stay the same

I wish that i could escape from 
myself
         <b>A#m</b>
But the beast feeds on itself
<b>A#m</b>
‘Cause every old man

Should know what’s better

And every ghost doesn’t know

Where he lost his head
<b>D#m</b>
By any chance
       <b>Fm</b>
Should we believe what they say?

<b>A#m</b>
Wise men talk

‘Cause they have something to say

Fools, ‘cause they have to say 
something

But of course only the wise

Knows how to silence

Should stay?

Shall we say?

Maybe someday fall our illusions

<b>D#m</b>
Should stay?

Shall we say?
               <b>A#m</b>
Is a revolution?
         <b>F#</b>        <b>D#m</b>
Or is it how we say
     <b>A#m</b>
Goodbye to ourselves?

(Fix me, love me, trust me, hold me)
              <b>A#m</b>
Is not emotion?

(Help me, save my feelings)
       <b>F#</b>       <b>D#m</b>
Is not our mistake?
      <b>A#m</b>
Our lost war?
<b>A#m</b>
Lonely
<b>F#</b>
Trying to keep me safe

( <b>D#m</b> )
