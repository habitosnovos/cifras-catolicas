One day a little girl came after me
She said she had to have an 
      <b>D</b>
interview
                             <b>A7</b>
A pencil and a paper in her hand
Those beautiful blue eyes open to 
 <b>D</b>
life
    <b>D7</b>                      
And looked into my eyes with 
           <b>G</b>
friendly Love
           <b>D</b>            <b>A7</b>        
To ask a question:Happiness? What 
    <b>D</b>
is it?

     <b>D7</b>                    <b>G</b>
You love as Jesus used to love
    <b>A7</b>                     <b>D</b>
You dream as Jesus used to dream
     <b>Bm</b>                    <b>A7</b>
You think as Jesus used to think

You live as Jesus used to live

      <b>D7</b>                     <b>G</b>
You feel as Jesus felt for people
    <b>A7</b>                      <b>F#m7</b>
You smile and cry the way he did it
    <b>Bm7</b>                  <b>Em</b>
And by the end of day I tell you
                  <b>A7</b>               
That you'll be as happy as you want
     <b>D</b> (<b>D7</b>)
 to be

<b>D</b>                                 
She heard what I had said an 
    <b>A7</b>
looked at me
She said I was so nice and talked so
 <b>D</b>
 well
She said she wondered if I could 
 <b>A7</b>
repeat
But please I should talk easy, not 
     <b>D</b>
too fast
    <b>D7</b>                            
And once again those beautiful blue 
<b>G</b>
eyes
             <b>D</b>        <b>A7</b>          
Were asking me happiness? What is 
<b>D</b>
it?

<b>D</b>                                <b>A7</b>
As soon as I had finished every word
She kept on looking at her little 
  <b>D</b>
book
                                  <b>A7</b>
And suddenly She jumped into my arms
With tears in her beautiful blue 
  <b>D</b>
eyes
    <b>D7</b>                         
And kissed me her good bye with 
   <b>G</b>
tender mood
             <b>D</b>          <b>A7</b>        
And left me saying what I said to 
<b>D</b>
her
