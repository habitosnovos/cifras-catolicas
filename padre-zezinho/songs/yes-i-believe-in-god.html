The stories I came here to tell

They speak of God, and truth, and 
love
           <b>A</b>               <b>E</b>
They show man in search of life
             <b>B</b>               <b>E</b>
And life itself in search of man
          <b>A</b>              <b>E</b>
God is always with his people
        <b>B</b>            <b>E</b>
Yet we hardly understand

Yes I believe in God

So many times I stop and wonder

Why we live the way we do
          <b>A</b>            <b>E</b>
For we say God came to earth
             <b>B</b>               <b>E</b>
And yet we hardly think of Him
      <b>A</b>             <b>E</b>
Everybody talks of hope
             <b>B</b>              <b>E</b>
And never sets his hope in Him

<b>E</b>                 <b>F#m</b>
Yes I believe in God
<b>B</b>                   <b>E</b>
Yes I believe in his love

<b>E</b>
Oh yes, I sure believe we could

With just a little more to show
             <b>A</b>            <b>E</b>
Change the world and our times
             <b>B</b>           <b>E</b>
If we just let religion grow
        <b>A</b>              <b>E</b>
But we shy from every effort
        <b>B</b>               <b>E</b>
All we say is “I don't know”

<b>E</b>                 <b>F#m</b>
Yes I believe in God
<b>B</b>                   <b>E</b>
Yes I believe in his love

<b>E</b>
I know this life could be so great

If we tried to imitate
          <b>A</b>            <b>E</b>
Joseph Mary and their Jesus
          <b>B</b>           <b>E</b>
In that house in Nazareth
           <b>A</b>            <b>E</b>
But some people make a house
              <b>B</b>               <b>E</b>
And find no time to build a home
<b>E</b>                 <b>F#m</b>
Yes I believe in God
<b>B</b>                   <b>E</b>
Yes I believe in his love
