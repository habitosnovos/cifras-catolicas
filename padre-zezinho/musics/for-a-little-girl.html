One day a little girl came after me
                                  <b>D</b>
She said she had to have an interview
                             <b>A7</b>
A pencil and a paper in her hand
                                   <b>D</b>
Those beautiful blue eyes open to life
    <b>D7</b>                                 <b>G</b>
And looked into my eyes with friendly Love
           <b>D</b>            <b>A7</b>            <b>D</b>
To ask a question:Happiness? What is it?

     <b>D7</b>                    <b>G</b>
You love as Jesus used to love
    <b>A7</b>                     <b>D</b>
You dream as Jesus used to dream
     <b>Bm</b>                    <b>A7</b>
You think as Jesus used to think
                          <b>D</b>
You live as Jesus used to live

      <b>D7</b>                     <b>G</b>
You feel as Jesus felt for people
    <b>A7</b>                      <b>F#m7</b>
You smile and cry the way he did it
    <b>Bm7</b>                  <b>Em</b>
And by the end of day I tell you
                  <b>A7</b>                    <b>D</b> (<b>D7</b>)
That you'll be as happy as you want to be

<b>D</b>                                     <b>A7</b>
She heard what I had said an looked at me
                                     <b>D</b>
She said I was so nice and talked so well
                                  <b>A7</b>
She said she wondered if I could repeat
                                        <b>D</b>
But please I should talk easy, not too fast
    <b>D7</b>                            <b>G</b>
And once again those beautiful blue eyes
             <b>D</b>        <b>A7</b>          <b>D</b>
Were asking me happiness? What is it?

<b>D</b>                                <b>A7</b>
As soon as I had finished every word
                                    <b>D</b>
She kept on looking at her little book
                                  <b>A7</b>
And suddenly She jumped into my arms
                                   <b>D</b>
With tears in her beautiful blue eyes
    <b>D7</b>                            <b>G</b>
And kissed me her good bye with tender mood
             <b>D</b>          <b>A7</b>        <b>D</b>
And left me saying what I said to her</pre>
