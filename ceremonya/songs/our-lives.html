<pre><b>C#m</b>
We are the pigs in the mud
We are living like a castaway
                           <b>E(add9)</b>   <b>D(add9)</b>
But afraid of the safe and distant shore
<b>C#m</b>
Will we fight for our food?
Will we live without escape?
                                 <b>B</b>      <b>E</b> <b>F#</b>  <b>A#</b>
Escape this truth that we have heard before

<b>D#m</b>  <b>C#/F</b>    <b>F#</b>
You know our lives
<b>D#m</b>      <b>C#</b>      <b>B</b>
Come for us and we'll be waiting
    <b>G#m</b>   <b>C#/F</b>   <b>B</b>   <b>G#</b>       <b>B</b>            <b>C#</b>
You justify      our fight and all of our prayers</pre>
