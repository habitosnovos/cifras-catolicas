Without works
We can't live the faith
Superficial life
Waiting for the Judgment Day
There's just one Lord for me
Even the demons have said this
We must kneel to fight
With the assurance of my faith

Lonely in the night
With You by my side

I won't receive the grace of God in vain
     <b>C#m</b>           <b>E/C#</b>
We dream of forever
                     <b>A/C#</b>          <b>E</b>    <b>B/D#</b> <b>C#m</b>
We hear the whisper of the wind
                             <b>E/C#</b>
We're living for the mission
                <b>A</b>                   <b>G#sus4</b> <b>G#</b>
Sometimes with no understanding
      <b>A</b>                 <b>G#sus4</b> <b>G#</b>
We want to live again

The precious childhood days</pre>
